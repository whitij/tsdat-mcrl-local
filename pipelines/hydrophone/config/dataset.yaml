  title: MCRLdata at PNNL-Sequim - Hydrophone
  description: "An Ocean Sonics icListen SC2-ETH-X2 hydrophone was installed on the Marine and 
  Coastal Research Laboratory (MCRL) pier at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) campus 
  in Sequim, Washington. This instrument is located 2 ft above the seafloor with the sensor directed up, 
  and measures average frequency spectra between 0 and 204 kHz, which can measures sources of sound such 
  as passing boats, marine mammals, and flow noise. This deployment is part of the MCRLdata project to 
  establish long-term marine monitoring at the PNNL-Sequim Campus."
