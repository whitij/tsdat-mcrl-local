# VAP Pipeline Cookiecutter

This cookiecutter template is intended to be used to generate boilerplate pipeline code
to accelerate the development of VAP/transformation pipelines.

To use it, make sure you have `cookiecutter` installed (This should already be
installed if you set up your development environment according to
[the instructions](../../README.md#development-environment-setup))

```shell
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then run the following command from the top-level directory of the repository:

```shell
cookiecutter templates/vap -o pipelines/
```
